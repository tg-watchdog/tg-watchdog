*Telegram Watchdog* is a Telegram bot used for anti-abuse from Telegram group chats.

- Use the private chat function with candidates instead of sending verify request messages in group chats.
- Use CAPTCHA and web app, complete verification in just clicks.
- Privacy first - no data will be saved or shared.
- Self-deployment supported.

## How to use
- [Set bot as admin](https://t.me/WatchdogVerifyBot?startgroup=start&admin=can_invite_users) of the group chat that you want to enable Telegram Watchdog
- Enable new member approval in group chats
- Thatâ€™s it! Share your group, and Telegram Watchdog will work for you when you have new candidates
